#titanic
## A project set to predict the likelihood a passenger will survive the ship's journey through the atlantic.
To do so, we have data on each passenger based on 12th col.:  
PassengerId,  
Survived (i.e. stayed alive - used to compare model accuracy),  
Pclass (Ticket class 	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd  == A proxy used to infer passenger's socio-economic status (SES): 1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower),  
Name,  
Sex,  
Age,  
SibSp (# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic),  
Parch (# of parents / children aboard the Titanic),  
Ticket (ticket number),  
Fare (cost of ticket),  
Cabin (cabin #),  
Embarked (Port of Embarkation - C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
